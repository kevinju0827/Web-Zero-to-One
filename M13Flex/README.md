# M13 Flex

## The "Why?"

## Goals

Master one-dimensional layouts for perfect alignment and flexible distribution of space.

## Core Concepts

## CheckPoints

* [ ] Apply `display: flex` to a container element to create a one-dimensional layout (e.g., a row of navigation links).
* [ ] Use `justify-content` to distribute space horizontally along the main axis.
* [ ] Use align-items to align items vertically along the cross-axis.
