# Web Zero to One

> **From absolute beginner to building modern, aesthetic websites—amplified by AI.**

Welcome to **Web Zero to One**.

This course is designed to take you from knowing nothing about code (Zero) to shipping your first real product (One).

Unlike traditional tutorials that force you to memorize every single tag, we focus on **foundational understanding** combined with **"Vibe Coding"**—leveraging AI to build faster, better, and with more style.

## Philosophy

In the age of AI, coding has changed. You don't need to hand-code every margin or padding.  

**However, AI is best suited for handling common requirements or building rapid prototypes.**

Due to context limitations, it often struggles to account for the full details of large-scale projects or handle highly specific, niche customizations.

To use AI effectively, you cannot rely on it blindly.

The core focus of this course is to equip you with the **understanding of programming concepts and basic syntax**.

This fundamental knowledge is the minimum requirement for you to review, modify, and fix the AI-generated content when it inevitably hallucinates.

## Curriculum Structure

The total estimated time required to complete this course is approximately **40 hours**.

The repository is organized into modules. Each module contains the following:

* **Goals & Checkpoints**:  
  Each module features a **Primary Goal** and a **Checkpoint** to verify your learning.
* **No Unique Solutions**:  
  Since we embrace the use of AI tools for content generation, **there is no single "correct" answer** for the checkpoints.
* **Focus on Quality**:  
  Instead of matching a standard answer, you should focus on building **maintainable and extensible code architectures**.  
  Your success is defined by your ability to **explain** your code and **modify** it confidently.

## A Note on JavaScript

This course intentionally excludes in-depth JavaScript instruction.

The JavaScript ecosystem is vast and introduces a higher layer of complexity.

While it is essential for building fully dynamic websites, we recommend mastering the foundational skills in this course before diving in.

You may encounter small amounts of JavaScript in this course (often generated by AI), but **proficiency is not required**.

## Recommended Resources

(Optional) In addition to the resources provided within this repository, we highly recommend learning from and utilizing the following:

* **[roadmap.sh Frontend Developer](https://roadmap.sh/frontend)**:  
  A visual guide to the developer landscape. Use this to track your progress and understand how different technologies fit together in the frontend ecosystem.
* **[W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com)**:  
  The "dictionary" of web development. It provides simple, isolated examples. Great for quick syntax lookups or when you need to check if a specific HTML tag or CSS property actually exists.
* **[MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org)**:  
  The gold standard documentation by Mozilla. If you need a deeper, more technical explanation of how the browser works, look here.
* **[Atguigu HTML5+CSS3](https://youtu.be/E-DErp0IcA0?list=PLmOn9nNkQxJGGuwYhQzTmRGFwF9cHYS-x)**  
  Comprehensive and free video tutorials in Chinese. An excellent choice if you prefer learning complex concepts through video content in Mandarin.
* **[Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com)**:  
  A game where you help Froggy and friends by writing CSS code. The most fun and intuitive way to master Flexbox layouts.
* **[CSS Grid Garden](https://cssgridgarden.com)**:
