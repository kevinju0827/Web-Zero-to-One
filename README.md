# Web Zero to One

> **From absolute beginner to building modern, aesthetic websites—amplified by AI.**

Welcome to **Web Zero to One**.

This course is designed to take you from knowing nothing about code (Zero) to writing and shipping your first real website (One).  
(Name referenced from Zero to Hero)

We'll learn how to use AI to generate rapid prototypes, then refine those outputs into production-ready code by building solid conceptual understanding.

The total estimated time required to complete this course is approximately **30 hours**.

## Philosophy

**AI is best suited for handling common requirements, boilerplate code, or building rapid prototypes.**

In the age of AI, coding has changed. You don't need to hand-code every single line anymore.

However, because AI works with limited context, it can struggle to account for the full details of large-scale projects or handle highly specific, complex business logic.

**To use AI effectively, you cannot rely on it blindly.**

The core focus of this course is to equip you with the **understanding of programming concepts, control flow, and basic syntax**.

This fundamental knowledge is the minimum requirement for you to review, modify, and fix the AI-generated content when it occasionally hallucinates or makes logical errors.

## Curriculum Structure

The repository is organized into modules. Each module in this course is designed as a self-contained learning journey, moving from conceptual understanding to practical mastery.

To ensure a consistent and effective learning experience, Each module contains the following:

1. **The "Why?"**  
   Before diving into the code, we answer the most important question: Why are we learning this?  
   You will explore how these specific concepts are applied in the real-world context.
2. **Goals**  
   The Goals serve as your objectives for learning this module.   
   Written in plain, accessible language, these goals define what you should understand and be able to articulate by the end of the module.
3. **Core Concepts**  
   This is the heart of the module. Core Concepts provide a deep-dive explanation of programming syntax and technical concepts.  
   It includes detailed explanations and code demonstrations for each topic.
4. **Checkpoints**  
   Checkpoints are designed to verify your learning through practical scripting.  
   Successfully completing these checkpoints serves as proof of your technical competency and readiness for the next module.  
   > **There is no single "correct" answer for the checkpoints.**  
   > Programming is about problem-solving. Since we embrace AI tools for code generation, success is defined by your ability to **explain** your logic, handle errors, and **modify** your code confidently.  
   > Please do not consider a checkpoint "done" just because AI produced an output.

## Tech Stack

### Languages

- **HTML5**  
  The standard markup language for structuring web content with semantic elements (headings, sections, forms, and media).
- **CSS3**  
  The styling language for designing layouts, typography, and responsive, modern-looking web pages across devices.

#### A Note on JavaScript

This course intentionally excludes in-depth JavaScript instruction.

The JavaScript ecosystem is vast and introduces a higher layer of complexity.

While it is essential for building fully dynamic websites, we recommend mastering the foundational skills in this course before diving in.

You may encounter small amounts of JavaScript in this course (often generated by AI), but **proficiency is not required**.
