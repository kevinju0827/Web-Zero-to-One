# M07 CSS Basic

## The "Why?"

## Goals

Separate content from design by moving styles to an external CSS file and mastering basic selectors.

## Core Concepts

## CheckPoints

* [ ] Create a separate style.css file and link it to your HTML document using the `<link>` tag.
* [ ] Refactor previous inline styles by moving them entirely to the external CSS file to maintain clean code architecture.
* [ ] Demonstrate the correct use of at least one Class selector (.classname) and one ID selector (#idname) in your CSS file.
