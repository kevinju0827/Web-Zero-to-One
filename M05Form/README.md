# M05 Form

## Goals

Build the UI for user input, focusing on the visual structure rather than backend processing.

## CheckPoints

* [ ] Create a `<form>` element containing at least three different input types (e.g., text, email, password).
* [ ] Ensure every `<input>` element is explicitly paired with a `<label>` using the for and id attributes.
* [ ] Add a `<button type="submit">` at the end of the form.
